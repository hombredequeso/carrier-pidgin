# Prototype: http message bus example

A project for demonstrating a very simple message bus over http transport. As such, this is not a framework/library to be used in production. It is primarily for example/educational purposes.

The design is loosely based on Vaughn Vernon's example in _Implementing Domain-Driven Design_, chapter 8.
