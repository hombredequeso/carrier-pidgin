# Prototype: http message bus example

A project for demonstrating a very simple message bus over http transport. As such, this is not a framework/library to be used in production. It is primarily for example/educational purposes.

The design is loosely based on Vaughn Vernon's example in _Implementing Domain-Driven Design_, chapter 8.

### Why Pidgin?
No it's not misspelt. Originally I was going to call it carrier-pigeon, because it, you know, carries messages around.
But the [fount of wisdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pidgin) has this to say about pidgin:
"is a grammatically simplified means of communication that develops between two or more groups that do not have a language in common: typically, a mixture of simplified languages or a simplified primary language with other languages' elements included."

And that language is http.

## Getting Started
